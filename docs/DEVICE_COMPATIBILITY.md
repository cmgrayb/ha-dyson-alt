## Troubleshooting Entity Availability

### Missing Air Quality Sensors
**Problem**: PM2.5/PM10 sensors not appearing
**Cause**: Device lacks ExtendedAQ capability
**Solution**: 
1. Verify device model supports air quality monitoring
2. Check device configuration includes ExtendedAQ capability
3. For manual setup, ensure ExtendedAQ is selected in capabilities

### Missing WiFi Monitoring
**Problem**: WiFi signal strength or connection status sensors missing
**Cause**: Device category not set to "ec" or "robot"
**Solution**:
1. Verify device category in integration configuration
2. For manual setup, select correct device category (Environment Cleaner or Robot)
3. Non-WiFi devices (like corded vacuums) don't support WiFi monitoring

### Missing Temperature Controls
**Problem**: No temperature sensor or climate platform
**Cause**: Device lacks Heating capability
**Solution**:
1. Verify device model supports heating (HP series, etc.)
2. Check device configuration includes Heating capability
3. For manual setup, ensure Heating is selected in capabilities

### Unexpected Sensors Appearing
**Problem**: Sensors showing for unsupported features
**Cause**: Incorrect capability or category configuration
**Solution**:
1. Review device capabilities in integration setup
2. Remove unsupported capabilities from manual configuration
3. Reconfigure integration with correct device category

## Configuration Best Practices

### For Cloud Discovery
- **Automatic**: Capabilities and categories detected from Dyson API
- **Verification**: Check entity list matches expected device features
- **Troubleshooting**: Wait for full device sync before reporting issues

### For Manual Setup
- **Research**: Verify device model capabilities before configuration
- **Conservative**: Start with basic capabilities, add features as needed
- **Documentation**: Refer to device manual or Dyson specs for supported features

### For Integration Health
- **Monitor**: Check connection status sensor for connectivity issues
- **Maintenance**: Watch filter life sensors for replacement scheduling
- **Performance**: Use air quality sensors for automation triggers
